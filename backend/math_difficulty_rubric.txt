LLM-Compatible Rubric for Predicting Math Problem Difficulty and Grade Level (Grades 1 to 12)

Purpose

Extract key features from a brief summary of a math problem

Predict both a difficulty level (Novice, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert) and a grade level (G1–G12)

Difficulty Levels and Grade Bands
1 = Novice (Grades 1–4)
2 = Beginner (Grades 5–7)
3 = Intermediate (Grades 8–10)
4 = Advanced (Grades 11–12)
5 = Expert (Advanced Grade 12, competition or university prep)

Assessment Criteria (for each problem summary)
• Grade Alignment: which grade’s curriculum it matches (G1–G12)
• Conceptual Complexity: how abstract or numerous the concepts are (scale 1–5)
• Procedural Complexity: how many steps and what kinds of operations are required (scale 1–5)
• Prior Knowledge: which theorems or skills must be known first (scale 1–5)
• Problem Structure:
– Direct versus hidden question
– Single-step versus multi-step
– Familiar (routine) versus novel type
– Abstract versus real-world context
– Number of variables or quantities to track
– Unique versus multiple solution paths
– Presence of distractors or trick elements
(assign 1–5 points to each sub-item, up to 35 total)
• Reasoning Type: logical, spatial, quantitative, inductive, etc. (scale 1–5)
• Time to Solve: expected minutes for a proficient student (<1, 1–5, 5–10, 10–20, >20)

Sample Summaries and Predictions
• “Calculate area of triangle given base 10 cm and height 6 cm.” → Novice → Grades G6–G7
• “Solve sin(x)=√2/2 for x in one period.” → Intermediate → Grades G10–G11
• “Find domain of 1/(x²−4).” → Intermediate → Grades G11–G12
• “Differentiate x²·sin(x).” → Advanced → Grade G12
• “Count permutations of ‘MISSISSIPPI’.” → Expert → Grade G12 / competition level
